* 2021-08131: Version 1.0.1.
  - Improved documentation.
  - Updated Python dependencies.

* 2019-02-11: Version 1.0. Significant improvements/changes:
  - All activity markers are now in the "deps/" directory with an
    extension. Before they were in a variety of directories
    such as scanned/ and tested/, but this created an untidy
    collection of top-level directories that most users won't care about.
    Multiple directories are unnecessary, because there is always a
    unique filename extension that explains what kind of marker it is.
  - Fixed subtle bugs in dependencies. Originally an executable context (EC)
    depended on the dependency file, but that's not right.
    If we regenerate the dependency file, by itself there's no reason
    to re-run the program.
  - Added support for "source context" (SC), which is similar to
    executable context but doesn't include the runtime inputs.
    This lets us support different kinds of source code scanners;
    some scanners only examine one file at a time (e.g., shellcheck),
    while other scanners examine their source dependency tree (e.g.,
    more recent versions of pylint).
  - If you want to completely *disable* the default rules for PYTHON_SCANNER
    or SHELL_SCANNER, set those values ":".
  - Modified how "$(call uses, ...)" invokes scans.
    Before, we made targets directly depend on scans for every program
    noted with "uses" (unless SKIPS_SCANS was set).
    That was simple, but it meant that if a scan had to be
    redone for program P then this *forced* re-execution of every
    program that uses P, *even* if the scan found there were no problems.
    For clean scans this is totally unnecessary.
    Now scans of a program are *not* automatically required when a
    rule "uses" program unless REQUIRE_SCANS is set.
    Note that "scan", "check", and "all" still invoke scans by default;
    we just don't force them at the level of individual rules.
